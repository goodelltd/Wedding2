        <p>Vicki's point of view:
            After saying goodbyes, Vicki secured Tyler’s email address and the
            rest is history. Well, that and about 15 flights to and from Texas,
            with side trips to Chile, New York, and West Virginia. Plus about
            800 phone calls and even more texts.
            Basically we couldn’t be happier, and we are so thankful to Tom and
            Kim especially, but everyone who played a part in getting us together.
        </p>
        <p>Tyler's point of view:
          I was just visiting my close friends, Kim and TJ, when Kim brought up that
          she had a cousin who was single. She then showed me a picture of
          her and I said, "Why not? Midland is right next door. And blonds are
          the big leagues." Then, fearing a long-distance relationship, I had second
          thoughts.<br>The night before I was about to leave St. George, I spent the night
          playing cards with Vicki and her family, and she didn't mind that I was cheating.
          I thought, "This girl is pretty chill. I would totally date her if she didn't
          live a billion miles away." I then left town not thinking too much more about it.
          After a lot of effort by Kim and TJ to bring us
          together, Vicki emailed me. This eventually turned into text messages,
          which eventually became phone calls, and then video calls. After a few months
          digital communication, we finally met up again on Thanksgiving and
          immediately hit if off. That Thanksgiving weekend is when I figured out
          that I was going to marry Vicki. And so here I am.
